QwadH
=====

QwadH is a quadricopter specially design to embed a brushless gimbal for GoPro camera or equivalent.
Originally made in carbon and 3D printed, Qwad H weights less than 2kg with camera onboard.
It gives you 10 to 15 minutes of a smooth but sharp flight.

This project attempts to bee the more Open Source it can. But we are dealing with hardware, so you will have to find motors, propellers, esc and some other electronics.

Hopefully, the firmware MultiWii used here to control the Qwad remains Free Software. It has been installed on a CRIUS All In One controler board you can connect and modify with the IDE ARDUINO.

So here, we share shapes and design to make your own QwadH.

Wadudu is an Open Source Hardware Project supported by the Conseil RÃ©gional d'Aquitaine and Aquinetic, started in july 2012 during RMLL in Geneva (rmll.info).
